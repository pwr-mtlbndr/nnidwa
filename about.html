				<h1>About</h1>
				<center><img src="trilogy.png" width="500" alt="cupcake"></center></br>
				<a href="lilynoblezada.png" style="font-weight: bold;">Lily Noblezada</a> was an American media personality, socialite, model, businesswoman, singer, and chef.
				On the evening of May 14, 2018, she killed 9 people and injured 21 others by gunshot, stabbing and vehicle ramming in <a href="santamonica.png">Santa Monica</a>, California during a meeting with her <a href="modellingagency.png">modelling agency</a>. She escaped the scene but was shortly found dead by gunshot at her home in <a href="beverlyhills.png">Beverly Hills</a>. Her autopsy report later shows that there was already a lethal dose of benzodiazepines in her system during the killings.</br>
				</br>
				Her death was ruled a probable suicide, although several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the years following her death.</br>
				</br>
				Due to the controversy surrounding her death, all of her social media accounts have since been terminated by her management. However, her cooking website "Lily Edibles" which she made herself is still running and being managed by her agent.</br>
